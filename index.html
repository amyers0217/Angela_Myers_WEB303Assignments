                        ambition and a huge appetite, often thinking with his stomach and comically gorging
                        himself. Knowing the danfer ahead, he is willing to risk his life to become King of
                        the Pirates and protect his crew.</p>

                        <p>Zoro has a stern, serioius, and distanced personality but often reacts in a 
                            goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his short-tempered and impatient
                            attitude. He is often the first to sense an enemy or danger and the first to
                            react. He is often displayed as being well aware of dangeroius situations and 
                            the people around him.</p>

                        <p>Usopp is one of the most sentimental of the crew and cries or gets angry
                            at times of emotional stress. At the beginning of the series, he was a lair and 
                            easily frightened, as well as anxiious, insecure, and compulsive. In desperate times
                            he is able to put all these issues aside.</p>

                        <p>Sanji is mostly seen as a composed, nonchalant, and calm individual who always keeps 
                            his cool when in dire situations. However, this is contrasted by the many comedic 
                            gags he partakes in, such as when in the presence of a lady or when insulted by a 
                            crew member.</p>
